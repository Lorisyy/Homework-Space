## 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine
1) LOD #1 (00)--> STO X (06)--> LOD X (00) --> ADD #3(10 XX) --> STO Y(06) --> HLT(10);
  
2) First , the machine main the memory , fetch the instruction , decode the instruction, get data from memory, exe the instruction , output the result to memory.

3) IR, Instruction Register,to regeister the instructions of computer that is being executed now.  PC, Program Counter, to count the program of computer.  ACC ,Accumulator,an accumulator is a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored. 

4) Their physical meaning is memory.(变量为内存)

## 2.Q&A：
### 1）What are stored in memory?
Digital Data.
### 2) Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
No.They are seperated.
### 3) Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
Instruction Format includes Address code and Opreration code .
常见的指令格式有以下几种。

①三地址指令：一般地址域中A1、A2分别确定第一、第二操作数地址,A3确定结果地址。下一条指令的地址通常由程序计数器按顺序给出。

②二地址指令：地址域中A1确定第一操作数地址，A2同时确定第二操作数地址和结果地址。

③单地址指令：地址域中A 确定第一操作数地址。固定使用某个寄存器存放第二操作数和操作结果。因而在指令中隐含了它们的地址。

④零地址指令：在堆栈型计算机中，操作数一般存放在下推堆栈顶的两个单元中，结果又放入栈顶,地址均被隐含，因而大多数指令只有操作码而没有地址域。

⑤可变地址数指令：地址域所涉及的地址的数量随操作定义而改变。如有的计算机的指令中的地址数可少至 0个，多至6个。

## 名词解释 
### 1.Assembly Language 
Assembly Language is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system.In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.  
### 2.Compiler 
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.  
### 3.Imperative Programming  
Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result. 

### 4.Functional Programming 
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming. 



### 5.Procedual Programming 
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC .Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
