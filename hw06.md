## 2.A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?

A:64 MegaBytes is 2^26 bytes, we need 26 bits.

## 3.List basic parts of CPU,include cache or not?

A CPU includes ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit),***Cache***,Data and bus.

## 4.Secondary Storage
Hard drive,CD,DVD...

## 5.CPU/RAM/ROM/BUS/Parallel Computing
### CPU:
A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
 ### RAM:
 Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.

 ### ROM:
 Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

 ### BUS:
 In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.

 ###Parallel Cpmputing:

 Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism.


## 6.About Cloud Computing:
What is Cloud Computing?  
A:Cloud computing is shared pools of configurable computer system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.  
Third-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.

Why is Cloud Computing Efficient?  
A:Cloud Computing is always accopanied byu MegaData,which is the hottest topic in Information technology.However,the footstone of the mega data is **data**.How can you get data that enable your supercomputer to calculate or compute?You Shall use Cloud.With the data on the cloud,computing those data by different efficient  algorithm is sure to be EFFICIENT!After all,you don't need to get your data person by person in reality,just on Cloud!

## 7.DDR3-1333 Memory
1):  
3 代表三代内存  1333代表1333Mhz的内存分频率。   
2）：  
不可以，最大为1333MHz。  
3）：  　
小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333  的内存能提高性能。　　
4）：  　
16GB ＝　16*1024*1024*1024 =2^34  
所以是34位地址。
