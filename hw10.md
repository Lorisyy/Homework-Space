## 1. Bubble Sort the list: 33, 56, 17, 8, 95, 22。Make sure the final result is from small to large.Write out the list after the 2nd pass. 
After 1st pass:
> 8 33 56 17 22 95
After 2nd pass:
> 8 17 33 56 22 95

## 2. Give a sorted array as list={60,65,75,80,90,95}. Design an algorithm to insert the value of x into the sorted array. Then test the algorithm with value 50,67,99.
Algorithm design:  
Knowing that the value of the list is from low to high,for a given value,we have to compare the the value with the first and the last,to test whether it is smaller than the smallest one or bigger than the largest one,if so,insert the value into the corresponding position,then array length++.  
If neither of the two requirement is met, we can use the idea of binary search tree ,if we got a place to settle the number,then settle the number in this position,then the length of array++.  
50 is inserted : {50,60,65,75,80,90,95}  
67 is inserted : {50,60,65,67,75,80,90,95}  
99 is inserted : {50,60,65,67,75,80,90,95,99}  
## 3. What is the state of the stack after the following sequence of Push and Pop operations? Push “anne”; Push “get”; Push “your” ; Pop; Push “my” Push “gun”
Suppose the stack is empty(Default situation)

After Push × 3: 

 your  
 get  
 anne

Pop:  
get  
 anne

 Result after all operation is done:  
 gun  
 my  
 get  
 anne
